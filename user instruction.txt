The Sentinel is a tester that runs test sets on Ampersand periodically.
If you like, you can run it on  http://sentinel.oblomov.com (which is a shortcut to http://sentinel.oblomov.com/www/sentinel.php).
The code can be found in the repository http://svnint.ou.nl:8080/svn/ADL/Sentinel/trunk.
Tests can be specified in  Sentinel/www/TestSpecs.txt and you may add
your e-mail adress to Sentinel/www/Authors.txt. Tests are run automatically each night at 5AM,
and upon request through the (rather primitive) web interface.
